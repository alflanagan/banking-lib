This is my version of coursework for the course "Building Microservices in Go" (Packt Publishing) on [Coursera](https://coursera.org)

It is **NOT** original work by A Lloyd Flanagan, is used by permission, and is public mainly because the go dependency system requires it.

For the real deal, see [ashishjuyal/banking-auth](https://github.com/ashishjuyal/banking-auth).
